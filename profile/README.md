# Software Development

A key part of [DNS-OARC's](https://www.dns-oarc.net) mission is to develop, maintain and host various software tools for DNS data collection, measurement and analysis. You can find a list of these tools below, with their source code and development management here on Github.

Many of these tools have been developed in-house over time by OARC and its contributors. Others have been developed externally, and either donated to OARC by the original owner, or in some cases OARC has taken custodianship for the community of DNS tools which have become 'orphaned' from their original developers.

In keeping with OARC's nonprofit status and public benefit mission, all of the software for our tools is made available under open-source licenses - see our [open-source licensing policy](https://www.dns-oarc.net/oarc/software).

# Funding Development

OARC also develops new tools as the need or opportunity for these arises. Funding for this development can come collectively from OARC's Members as part of its wider mission, from external 3rd-party grants, or can be done under contract in response to the custom needs of a specific requirement.

OARC can develop new, or enhance features of existing, tools via a custom for-hire development contract. We can accept such work from either OARC Members, or other parties (subject to available resources). OARC Members will receive priority for such work, and at a discounted rate depending on their [Membership tier](https://www.dns-oarc.net/oarc/agreements).

If you are interested in having OARC do custom tool development work, please contact us at admin at dns-oarc.net, and we'll be happy to discuss your requirements. We'd also welcome patches to, contributions, or donations of relevant tool code.

# Support

If you are looking for support of existing OARC tools, we have a Mattermost channel for general support for all software at [OARC Software](https://chat.dns-oarc.net/community/channels/oarc-software) and we recommend you post questions or requests for help there in the first instance. For specific bug reports, we recommend raising these as issues on the projects.
